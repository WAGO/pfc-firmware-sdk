	  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools

	  OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
	  toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
	  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well
	  as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

	  You need it to perform certain cryptographic actions like:
	  * Creation of RSA, DH and DSA key parameters;
	  * Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs;
	  * Calculation of message digests;
	  * Encryption and decryption with ciphers;
	  * SSL/TLS client and server tests;
	  * Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail.
