	  Pathfinder is designed to provide a mechanism for any
	  program to perform RFC3280-compliant path validation
	  of X.509 certificates, even when some of the intermediate
	  certificates are not present on the local machine. It will
	  automatically download any such certificates (and their
	  CRLs) from the Internet as needed using the AIA and CRL
	  distribution point extensions of the certificate it is
	  processing.
