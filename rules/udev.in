	  udev provides a dynamic device directory containing only the files for
	  actually present devices. It creates or removes device node files in the
	  /dev directory, or it renames network interfaces.

	  Usually udev runs as udevd(8) and receives uevents directly from the
	  kernel if a device is added or removed from the system.

	  If udev receives a device event, it matches its configured rules against
	  the available device attributes provided in sysfs to identify the
	  device. Rules that match, may provide additional device information or
	  specify a device node name and multiple symlink names and instruct udev
	  to run additional programs as part of the device event handling.

	  Ensure: This udev implementation requires at least kernel 2.6.32 and
	  must have sysfs, unix domain sockets, networking and devtmpfs enabled.

	  If enabled, very verbose debugging messages will be compiled

	  If enabled, udev is able to pass errors or debug information
	  to syslog. This is very useful to see what udev is doing or not doing.
