     pureftpd is configured by command-line options.
     /etc/pure-ftpd.conf has to be parsed manually.
     Depending on the init system (sysv/systemd) different
     approaches may be driven.
     NOTE: currently there is no solution for systemd.

	  To efficiently use features of modern FTP clients, Pure-FTPd implements
	  the basics of the FTP protocol, with many extensions (SITE IDLE,
	  SITE CHMOD, MLSD, ...) . Using this switch, these extensions won't be
	  compiled in. Also, there will be no standalone server, no lookup for
	  user/group names, no humor and no ASCII support. But the executable
	  file size will be smaller than in a default installation. Regular
	  expressions are still working.

# FIXME: Check if this is true: pure-ftpd cannot be started standalone when a minimal
# server was built. Seems not yet. If yes, disable standalone script, when a minimal
# server was built!

config PUREFTPD_SHRINK_MORE

	  If you still want to reduce the size, use also this switch and don't
	  include the globbing code. It reduces the memory footprint but regular
	  expressions won't work any more (things like 'ls *.rpm').
	  But note: Globbing is a nice feature and for Windows clients most of
	  time required!
