	  Networking and traffic control tools

	  The iproute suite, also known as iproute2, is a collection
	  of utilities for networking and traffic control.

	  These tools communicate with the Linux kernel via the
	  (rt)netlink interface, providing advanced features not
	  available through the legacy net-tools commands 'ifconfig'
	  and 'route'.
