	  The ncurses libraries implement the curses API.  The panel, menu and
	  forms libraries implement clones of the SVr4 panel, menu and forms
	  APIs. The source code for these lives in the `ncurses', `panel',
	  `menu', and `form' directories respectively.
	  For a smaller library select the termcap package instead of ncurses.

config NCURSES_WIDE_CHAR
	bool "Enable wide char support"
	help
	  Build ncurses with wide-char/UTF-8 code support. This will create
	  the wide character libraries used by some other programs to support
	  utf8. They are backward API compatible with the non wide char libraries.

config NCURSES_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE_NON_WIDE_CHAR
	bool "Create links for backward compatibility"
	depends on NCURSES_WIDE_CHAR
	help
	  Creates links to the wide char libraries with non wide names to support
	  applications that are externally linked against the non wide libraries.
	  This is not required for applications built within this project.

config NCURSES_BIG_CORE
	bool "Enable the big core"
	default y
	help
	  Disable this entry if your target machine has little memory.
	  Note: Not all programs that need ncurses may run with this feature
	  disabled.

config NCURSES_TERMCAP
	bool "install minimal set of termcap data files"
	default y
	help
		Installs the following termcap files:
		- xterm
		- xterm-color
		- xterm-xfree86
		- vt100
		- vt200
		- ansi
		- linux
		- screen

config NCURSES_FORM
	bool "Install libform on the target"
	help
	  From the manual:
	  If you have seen those forms on web pages which take input from users
	  and do various kinds of things, you might be wondering how would any
	  one create such forms in text mode display. It's quite difficult to
	  write those nifty forms in plain ncurses. Forms library tries to provide
	  a basic frame work to build and maintain forms with ease. It has lot
	  of features(functions) which manage validation, dynamic expansion of
	  fields etc..

config NCURSES_MENU
	bool "Install libmenu on the target"
	help
	  The menus library provides a nice extension to basic curses, through
	  which you can create menus. It provides a set of functions to create
	  menus. But they have to be customized to give a nicer look, with
	  colors etc.

config NCURSES_PANEL
	bool "Install libpanel on the target"
	help
	  This library handles windows on the screen.
	  From the manual:
	  If you have lot of overlapping windows, then panels library is the way
	  to go. It obviates the need of doing series of wnoutrefresh(),
	  doupdate() and relieves the burden of doing it correctly(bottom up).
	  The library maintains information about the order of windows, their
 	  overlapping and update the screen properly.
