	  dropbear is an SSH 2 server and client designed
	  to be small enough to be used in small memory
	  environments, while still being functional and
	  secure enough for general use.

	  It implements most required features of the
	  SSH 2 protocol, and other features such as X11
	  and authentication agent forwarding.

config DROPBEAR_KEY_DIR
	string "dropbear key directory"
	default "/etc/dropbear"
	help
	  This is the directory where dropbear stores the keys.

config DROPBEAR_MOTD
	bool
	default n
	prompt "print message of the day (MOTD)"
	help
	  Whether to print the message of the day (MOTD).

config DROPBEAR_ZLIB
	bool
	prompt "zlib support"
	help
	  Disable compression in Dropbear by dropping use of
	  zlib.
	  If you disable zlib, you must explicitly disable
	  compression for the client - OpenSSH is possibly
	  buggy in this regard, it seems you need to disable it
	  globally in ~/.ssh/config, not just in the host entry
	  in that file.

config DROPBEAR_DIS_OPENPTY
	bool
	prompt "Don't use openpty, use alternative method"
	help
	  If openpty() is being used (HAVE_OPENPTY defined in config.h) and it fails,
	  you can try compiling with --disable-openpty. You will probably then need
	  to create all the /dev/pty?? and /dev/tty?? devices, which can be
	  problematic for devfs. In general, openpty() is the best way to allocate
	  PTYs, so it's best to try and get it working.

config DROPBEAR_DIS_SYSLOG
	bool
	prompt "Don't include syslog support"
	help
	  Keep dropbear from writing to syslog.
	  This option is useful for small or flash-based filesystems.

	prompt "disable use of lastlog"
	help
	  Keep dropbear from writing to lastlog.
	  This option is useful for small or flash-based filesystems.

	  X11 forwarding means passing X11 (graphical interface)
	  information over the SSH connection.

config DROPBEAR_DIS_TCP

	  TCP forwarding means the tunneling of TCP ports over
	  the SSH connection.

config DROPBEAR_DIS_AGENT

	  Authentication agent is a program to automate the
	  use of authentication private keys.

config DROPBEAR_DIS_SFTPSERVER

	help
	  If you want to enable running an sftp server (such as the
	  one included with OpenSSH), set the path below and set
	  DROPBEAR_SFTPSERVER. The sftp-server program is not provided
	  by Dropbear itself

	  algorithm that may be used by U.S. Government organizations
	  (and others) to protect sensitive information.

config DROPBEAR_3DES
	bool
	prompt "3DES"
	help
	  DES is an IBM algorithm designed during the 1970s.
	  In 1976, NIST has officially adopted it as an encryption
	  algorithm for unclassified data. Since then, DES has
	  become one of the widely used block ciphers on the
	  market. As the effective key length of DES is a 56-bit,
	  a triple-DES was created. The new 3DES concept uses
	  three DES rounds to encrypt the DATA 3 times.

	  Another great algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier.
	  This block cipher was designed as a successor to

	prompt "ChaCha20Poly1305"
	help
	  Enable Chacha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption mode. This
	  is generally faster than AES256 on CPU w/o dedicated AES

	  Compiling in will add ~5,5kB to binary size on x86-64

config DROPBEAR_DH_GROUP14_SHA1
	bool
	prompt "dh group14 sha1"
	help
	  Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups determine the strength of the key
	  used in the key exchange process.
	  This method uses [RFC3526] group14 (a 2048-bit MODP group).
	  DH group14 with SHA-1 is supported by most implementations.

config DROPBEAR_DH_GROUP14_SHA256
	bool
	prompt "dh group14 sha256"
	help
	  Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups determine the strength of the key used

	  with a SHA-2 (SHA2-256) hash.

config DROPBEAR_DH_GROUP16_SHA256
	bool
	prompt "dh group16 sha256"
	help
	  Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups determine the strength of the key used
	  in the key exchange process.
	  This modulus (4096-bit) is larger than that required by [CNSA-SUITE]
	  and should be sufficient to inter-operate with more paranoid
	  nation-states.

config DROPBEAR_DH_GROUP1_SHA1
	bool
	prompt "dh group1 sha1"
	default n
	help
	  Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups determine the strength of the key used in
	  the key exchange process. This method uses [RFC7296] Oakley Group 2
	  (a 1024-bit MODP group) and SHA-1 [RFC3174]. Due to recent security
	  concerns with SHA-1 [RFC6194] and with MODP groups with less than 2048
	  bits (see [LOGJAM] and [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1]), this method is considered
	  insecure.
	  This option is for compatibility with old server implementations. There
	  are many old implementations out there that may still need to use this key
	  exchange.

config DROPBEAR_CBC_CIPHERS
	bool
	prompt "CBC mode ciphers"
	help
	  Enable CBC mode for ciphers. This has security issues though
	  is the most compatible with older SSH implementations.

config DROPBEAR_CTR_CIPHERS
	bool
	prompt "Counter mode ciphers"
	default y
	help
	  Enable "Counter Mode" for ciphers. This is more secure than normal
	  CBC mode against certain attacks. This adds around 1kB to binary
	  size and is recommended for most cases.

config DROPBEAR_GCM_CIPHERS
	bool
	prompt "Galois/Counter mode ciphers"
	default n
	help
          Enable "Galois/Counter Mode" for ciphers. This authenticated
          encryption mode is combination of CTR mode and GHASH. Recommended
          for security and forwards compatibility, but slower than CTR on
          CPU w/o dedicated AES/GHASH instructions.
          Compiling in will add ~6kB to binary size on x86-64
