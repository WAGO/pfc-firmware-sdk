	The run-init utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	pivot_root.

	Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	(which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	or unmounted, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	run-init deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	then execs the specified init program.

	util-linux has a similar tool, switch-root.
	run-init differs by also having a "-d CAPS_TO_DROP" option.
