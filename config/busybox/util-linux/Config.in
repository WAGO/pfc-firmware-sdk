	help
	acpid listens to ACPI events coming either in textual form from
	/proc/acpi/event (though it is marked deprecated it is still widely
	used and _is_ a standard) or in binary form from specified evdevs
	(just use /dev/input/event*).

	It parses the event to retrieve ACTION and a possible PARAMETER.
	It then spawns /etc/acpi/<ACTION>[/<PARAMETER>] either via run-parts
	(if the resulting path is a directory) or directly as an executable.

	N.B. acpid relies on run-parts so have the latter installed.

	default y
	select BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	fdflush is only needed when changing media on slightly-broken
	removable media drives. It is used to make Linux believe that a
	hardware disk-change switch has been actuated, which causes Linux to
	forget anything it has cached from the previous media. If you have
	such a slightly-broken drive, you will need to run fdflush every time
	you change a disk. Most people have working hardware and can safely
	leave this disabled.

	this disabled.
config BUSYBOX_FSCK_MINIX
	bool "fsck.minix (13 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The minix filesystem is a nice, small, compact, read-write filesystem
	with little overhead. It is not a journaling filesystem however and
	can experience corruption if it is not properly unmounted or if the
	power goes off in the middle of a write. This utility allows you to
	check for and attempt to repair any corruption that occurs to a minix
	filesystem.

config BUSYBOX_GETOPT
	bool "getopt (5.8 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The getopt utility is used to break up (parse) options in command
	lines to make it easy to write complex shell scripts that also check
	for legal (and illegal) options. If you want to write horribly
	complex shell scripts, or use some horribly complex shell script
	written by others, this utility may be for you. Most people will
	wisely leave this disabled.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_GETOPT_LONG
	bool "Support -l LONGOPTs"
	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_GETOPT && BUSYBOX_LONG_OPTS

	select BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The hwclock utility is used to read and set the hardware clock
	on a system. This is primarily used to set the current time on
	shutdown in the hardware clock, so the hardware will keep the
	correct time when Linux is _not_ running.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_HWCLOCK_ADJTIME_FHS
	bool "Use FHS /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime"

	help
	The mkswap utility is used to configure a file or disk partition as
	Linux swap space. This allows Linux to use the entire file or
	partition as if it were additional RAM, which can greatly increase
	the capability of low-memory machines. This additional memory is
	much slower than real RAM, but can be very helpful at preventing your
	applications being killed by the Linux out of memory (OOM) killer.
	Once you have created swap space using 'mkswap' you need to enable
	the swap space using the 'swapon' utility.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MKSWAP_UUID

	any need to reading text files, you can leave this disabled.
config BUSYBOX_MOUNT
	bool "mount (23 kb)"
	default y
	select BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	All files and filesystems in Unix are arranged into one big directory
	tree. The 'mount' utility is used to graft a filesystem onto a
	particular part of the tree. A filesystem can either live on a block

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_HELPERS
	bool "Support mount helpers"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_MOUNT
	help
	Enable mounting of virtual file systems via external helpers.
	E.g. "mount obexfs#-b00.11.22.33.44.55 /mnt" will in effect call
	"obexfs -b00.11.22.33.44.55 /mnt"
	Also "mount -t sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" will try
	"sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" if simple mount syscall fails.
	The idea is to use such virtual filesystems in /etc/fstab.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_LABEL

	help
	The pivot_root utility swaps the mount points for the root filesystem
	with some other mounted filesystem. This allows you to do all sorts
	of wild and crazy things with your Linux system and is far more
	powerful than 'chroot'.

	Note: This is for initrd in linux 2.4. Under initramfs (introduced
	in linux 2.6) use switch_root instead.
config BUSYBOX_RDATE

config BUSYBOX_SWITCH_ROOT
	bool "switch_root (5.5 kb)"
	default y
	select BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The switch_root utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	pivot_root. (Stop reading here if you don't care why.)

	Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	(which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	or unmounted*, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	switch_root deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	then execs the specified init program.

	* Because the Linux kernel uses rootfs internally as the starting
	and ending point for searching through the kernel's doubly linked
	list of active mount points. That's why.

config BUSYBOX_TASKSET

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	bool "Support loopback mounts"
	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_MOUNT || BUSYBOX_UMOUNT
	help
	Enabling this feature allows automatic mounting of files (containing
	filesystem images) via the linux kernel's loopback devices.
	The mount command will detect you are trying to mount a file instead
	of a block device, and transparently associate the file with a
	loopback device. The umount command will also free that loopback
	device.

	You can still use the 'losetup' utility (to manually associate files
	with loop devices) if you need to do something advanced, such as
	specify an offset or cryptographic options to the loopback device.
	(If you don't want umount to free the loop device, use "umount -D".)

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP_CREATE
	bool "Create new loopback devices if needed"
	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	help
	Linux kernels >= 2.6.24 support unlimited loopback devices. They are
	allocated for use when trying to use a loop device. The loop device
	must however exist.

	This feature lets mount to try to create next /dev/loopN device
	if it does not find a free one.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MTAB_SUPPORT
	bool "Support old /etc/mtab file"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_MOUNT || BUSYBOX_UMOUNT
	select BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	help
	Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	your kernel.
