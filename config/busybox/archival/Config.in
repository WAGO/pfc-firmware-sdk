	bool "ar (9.5 kb)"
	default n  # needs to be improved to be able to replace binutils ar
	help
	ar is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	extract contents from archives. In practice, it is used exclusively
	for object module archives used by compilers.

	Unless you have a specific application which requires ar, you should
	probably say N here: most compilers come with their own ar utility.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_AR_LONG_FILENAMES

	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_AR
	help
	By default the ar format can only store the first 15 characters
	of the filename, this option removes that limitation.
	It supports the GNU ar long filename method which moves multiple long
	filenames into a the data section of a new ar entry.

config BUSYBOX_FEATURE_AR_CREATE

	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_AR
	help

	Unless you have a specific application which requires bunzip2, you
	should probably say N here.
