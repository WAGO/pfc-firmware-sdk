 *
 * puff.c is a simple inflate written to be an unambiguous way to specify the
 * deflate format.  It is not written for speed but rather simplicity.  As a
 * side benefit, this code might actually be useful when small code is more
 * important than speed, such as bootstrap applications.  For typical deflate
 * data, zlib's inflate() is about four times as fast as puff().  zlib's
 * inflate compiles to around 20K on my machine, whereas puff.c compiles to
 * around 4K on my machine (a PowerPC using GNU cc).  If the faster decode()
 * function here is used, then puff() is only twice as slow as zlib's
 * inflate().
 *
 * All dynamically allocated memory comes from the stack.  The stack required
 * is less than 2K bytes.  This code is compatible with 16-bit int's and
 * assumes that long's are at least 32 bits.  puff.c uses the short data type,
 * assumed to be 16 bits, for arrays in order to conserve memory.  The code
 * works whether integers are stored big endian or little endian.
 *
 * In the comments below are "Format notes" that describe the inflate process
 * and document some of the less obvious aspects of the format.  This source
 * code is meant to supplement RFC 1951, which formally describes the deflate
 * format:

  Decryption code comes from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly reduced in terms of
  compatibility with older software. The following is from the original crypt.c.
  Code woven in by Terry Thorsen 1/2003.

  Copyright (c) 1990-2000 Info-ZIP.  All rights reserved.

  See the accompanying file LICENSE, version 2000-Apr-09 or later
  (the contents of which are also included in zip.h) for terms of use.

        crypt.c (full version) by Info-ZIP.      Last revised:  [see crypt.h]

  The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
  non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
  whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
  (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

        This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
  Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
  file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
  version without encryption capabilities).

        Changes in unzip.c

        2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Addition of cpl_unzGetCurrentFileZStreamPos
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Decoration of symbol names unz* -> cpl_unz*
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Remove old C style function prototypes
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Add unzip support for ZIP64

        Copyright (C) 2007-2008 Even Rouault


        Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Removed cpl_* from symbol names (Even Rouault added them but since this is now moved to a new project (minizip64) I renamed them again).
  Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Fixed problem if uncompressed size was > 4G and compressed size was <4G
                                should only read the compressed/uncompressed size from the Zip64 format if
                                the size from normal header was 0xFFFFFFFF
  Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied some bug fixes from paches recived from Gilles Vollant
        Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied support to unzip files with compression mathod BZIP2 (bzip2 lib is required)
                                Patch created by Daniel Borca

  Jan-2010 - back to unzip and minizip 1.0 name scheme, with compatibility layer
