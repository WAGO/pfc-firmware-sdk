/etc/config-tools/events

Each of the subdirectories coresponds to a specific event in the system for
which hooks maybe registered. When an event occures all scripts from its
corresponding directory are called using "run-parts" CLI tool.

The structure may be extended if necessary, but each added event should be
described in details either here below in the file, or in a EVENT file stored
in the event directory.


============================ System Services Events ============================

The following directories

/etc/config-tools/events/dhcp           - dhcpd demon
/etc/config-tools/events/dns            - dns demon
/etc/config-tools/events/snmp           - snmp demon
/etc/config-tools/events/ssh            - ssh demon
/etc/config-tools/events/ssl            - lighttpd and pureftp demons
/etc/config-tools/events/tftp           - tftp demon
/etc/config-tools/events/iocheckport    - block/unblock access to iocheck demon.
/etc/config-tools/events/networking     - network config hostname, domainname,
                                          dns-servers, or default gateway changed.

correspond to events releated to a specific system services and are called in
one of three cases:
- start - when the /etc/init.d/NNN script was called with "start" argument,
- stop - when the /etc/init.d/NNN script was called with "stop" argument,
- config - when configuration of a given service has changed, but
           /etc/init.d/NNN wasn't called with neither "start" nor "stop"
           argument.
When a given event is fired its type (start, stop, config) is given to
each called scripts as its first parameter, e.g.
run-parts -a start /etc/config-tools/events/ssh/
is executed when /etc/init.d/dropbear start is called.
