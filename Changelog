Fieldbus Interface & Protocols:
-CAN
[FIXED] PFC CANopen Slave sends no heartbeat when bus detection fails

Web Based Management:
[NEW] root now has the same access rights to WBM like user "admin". By login
      with username "root", the user can change the password of linux user
      root and is not in need to change root password via SSH.
      For security reasons, only users which are part of a WBM user group are
      able to access WBM. All other users will rejected at WBM login.
[NEW] WBM provides information about the used trademarks.
[NEW] Force booting from the internal flash only and prohibit booting from SD
      card. Notice: if you force booting from internal flash, an update is
      only possibled via ETHERNET. There is a risk that you will no longer be
      able to connect to the device if there are any problems.

[CHANGED] The Fast Aging function has been replaced by the MAC Learning
          function. A device with MAC Learning enabled on all ethernet
          interfaces behaves in the same way as a device with Fast Aging
          disabled behaved in the past. NEW: MAC Learning is also available on
          all 4-port devices (0750-8210,750-8211 and 750-8215).
[DEPRECATED] Config tool function get_telecontrol_state will be removed in
             future re-leases. The config tool was used to determine whether a
             device is a telecontrol. Since telecontrol services can be added
             by dynamic licensing, the tool is no longer needed.
[DEPRECATED] DHCP and DNS Server will be removed in future releases. For the
             transition, it will be included for now. In the next release, the
             servers will still be partd of the firmware.
