Subject: [PATCH 188/292] dts: fix USB not initiate bug on 8207 devices

The ti,am3517-evm compatible string got lost by rename of dts-tree
in commit a88f655c29213a9c2885d9697f268b4c31335ea0.The "ti,am3517-evm"
compatible string enables the calling of am3517_evm_legacy_init.
The function am3517_evm_legacy resets emac and initiate musb. This
initialization of musb is needed for 8207 with USB 3G Modem. This patch
add the missing compatible string back to dts for all am35xx based PFC's.
