Subject: [PATCH 180/292] net: br_if: update bridge mac address while addig

When adding a new bridge (brctl addbr), an initial
MAC address is assigned to the bridge.
This initial MAC address can be randomly generated or
it can be received from a source, e.g. the device-tree.
The MAC address is not added to fdb by default.
If a user manually sets a MAC address to the bridge,
that equals the initial MAC address, the bridge does
not change the MAC address, but sets the NET_ADDR_SET flag.
The flag NET_ADDR_SET prevents subsequent changes of the
MAC address when adding Ethernet interfaces.
As a result the bridge's MAC address will never be added
to fdb. Thus frames with this destination MAC address will
never be forwarded to the bridge.
This patch call changes the MAC address function when
adding a new bridge. This function adds the MAC address
to fdb and fixes the bug.
